<h2>The Easter Bunny</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>With a hip</li>
			<li>and a hop,</li>
			<li>kids don't want</li>
			<li>the Easter fun to ever stop!</li>	
			<li></li>

			<li>Finding the brightly colored </li>
			<li>Easter eggs carefully hidden and lain</li>
			<li>and eating all of the Easter goodies</li>
			<li>that Grandma has made!</li>		
		</ul>
<h2>I Had an Easter Bunny</h2> 
		<ul>
			<li>I had an Easter bunny,</li>
			<li>One day she ran away.</li>
			<li>I looked for her by moonlight,</li>
			<li>I looked for her by day.</li>
			<li>I found her in the meadow</li>
			<li>With her babies 1, 2, 3.</li>
			<li>So now I have four rabbit pets</li>
			<li>To run and jump with me. </li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>Little Easter, the comedienne bunny,</li> 
			<li>Tried too hard at being funny. </li>
			<li>She juggled and she dropped the eggs, </li>
			<li>They fell and smashed between her legs. </li>
			<li></li>
			<li>Poor Easter left the stage in shame</li> 
			<li>And thought that she might change her name.</li>
 			<li>But then that bunny read this ad, </li>
			<li>"This Sunday we need help real bad." </li>
